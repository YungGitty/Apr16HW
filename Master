This is the master file.
I will now proceed with adding 4 different branches. 
I will push those branches up to github, per the hw instructions. 
See Below:
Create a repository , create 4 different branches, put files in them , push them up to the repo
Commands to keep in mind ( git clone <url> , git add . , git commit -m "message" , git push -u origin <branch name> )
** bonus, create a pull request from one of your branches to your master
